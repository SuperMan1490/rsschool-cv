3. I graduated from a higher educational institution with a degree in Automation of technological processes and production. However, setting up the PID controllers did not really catch on, but the few items with programming brought pleasure, which prompted me to study frontend development in more detail.
4. A little experience with:
    * _HTML, CSS_
    * _Python_
    * _C++_
5. Sample code from the site 'Ð¡odewars':
```javascript
function multiply(a, b){
  return (a * b);
}
```
